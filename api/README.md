Eng<->Mon Eng->Eng dictionary dedicated for Mongolian sister and brothers.

To start the app, make sure you are in mango-mobile/api directory.
Then run, 
```npm run devStart```

To test if the build is successful, running:
```curl --location --request GET 'localhost:3000/dict?en=paper'```
from terminal would give the following result.
```{"en":"paper","mn":"tsaas"}%```

Have fun coding!
